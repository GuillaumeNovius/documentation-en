Create your own Behaviour
#########################

You can add any class as a behaviour by adding its full classname to the ``$_behaviours`` property of your model.


Extends the Orm_Behaviour class
===============================

To create a behaviour, you need to create a class that extends **Nos\\Orm_Behaviour**, containing the events methods on
which you want your behaviour to act.


Properties
----------

When defining a behaviour, you can have a configuration array, which will be available in the **$this->_properties**
variable when inside the behaviour.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    class Model_Monkey extends Nos\Orm\Model
    {
        protected static $_behaviours = array(
            'My_Behaviour' => array(
                'configuration' => 'defined here',
            ),
        );
    }

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    class My_Behaviour extends Nos\Behaviour
    {
        /*
         * In any method, $this->_properties will contain :
         * array(
         *     'configuration' => 'defined here',
         * )
         */
    }


Then, you need to add some events. They are of two types: **instance** events and **static** events.


Instance events
---------------

Instance events act depending on a model instance. They always receive the latter one as a first parameter, and optionally
other parameters specific to the event.

The :ref:`list of instance events <api:php/behaviours/behaviour_event/instance>` is available in the API documentation.

Exemple with the  **form_processing** instance event (triggered when an item is saved using the CRUD).

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    class My_Behaviour extends Nos\Behaviour
    {
        public function form_processing(Nos\Orm\Model $item, $data, &$json_repsonse)
        {
            // Examples:
            // We fill in values to save in the item
            // We add some keus in the JSON array
        }
    }

    // For information: internally, Novius OS calls this event in the following manner:
    $item->event('form_processing', array($data, &$json_response));


The event will be called for every Behaviour which defined the corresponding method.


Static events
-------------

Static events act globally on a model, and not a particular instance.

The :ref:`list of static events <api:php/behaviours/behaviour_event/static>` is available in the API documentation.

Static do not receive the model instance as first parameter, but only the parameters specific to the event.

For instance, behaviours can listen to events which allow them to alter the AppDesk or the CRUD configuration.

Use cases:

- The :ref:`Publishable <api:php/behaviours/publishable>` behaviour, which add a field in the CRUD configuration and
  displays it with the Renderer_Publishable
- The :ref:`Urlenhancer <api:php/behaviours/urlenhancer>`, :ref:`Twinnable <php/behaviours/twinnable>` and :ref:`Sharable <php/behaviours/sharable>`
  behaviours which respectively add the **visualise**, **translate** and **share** actions.

Example with the **crudConfig** event:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    class My_Behaviour extends Nos\Behaviour
    {
        public function crudConfig(&$config, $controller)
        {
            // Example:
            // We add a field by modifying $config['fields']
        }
    }

    // For information: internally, Novius OS canns this event in the following manner:
    Model_Class::eventStatic('crudConfig', $config, $controller);
