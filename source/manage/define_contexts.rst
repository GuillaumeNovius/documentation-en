Define your site’s languages and contexts
#########################################

With Novius OS, you can manage several sites and/or languages in the same back-office. We call ‘context’ a site / language pair.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/understand/multi_context/principles`

You can define the contexts at any time, even after the site was launched. Just change the :file:`contexts.config.php` file.
