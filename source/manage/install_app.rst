Where to find apps
******************

`Novius OS’ GitHub account <http://github.com/novius-os>`__ is a good place to start. Check out the `contributors’ page <http://community.novius-os.org/Get-involved/our-awesome-contributors.html>`__ on Novius OS website for applications from the community. You could also go straight to `Fumito Mizuno <http://github.com/ounziw>`__ and `Novius Agency <http://github.com/novius>`__’s GitHub accounts which feature many apps.
