Copy style guide
****************

We take copywriting and translation very seriously. We have therefore established guidelines common to all applications and languages in order to provide every Novius OS user with consistent and enjoyable copy.

* Copy style guide (English)
* Charte rédactionnelle (Français)
* スタイルガイド（日本語）

The copy style guide is to be read by every translator. If it's not available in your language then it is the first document to translate.

.. note::

    We're happy to have the style guide translated by a professionnal translator. This key document may indeed prove hard to localise. Please `contact us <http://www.novius-os.org/en/more-info/contacts.html>`__ about this translation.

Translation server
******************

Novius OS translation server is available at `translate.novius-os.org <http://translate.novius-os.org>`__. It is powered by `Pootle <http://pootle.translatehouse.org>`__. Here is a quick guide to Pootle. You may also want to have a look at `Evernote's handy tour of Pootle <http://translate.evernote.com/i/tour/>`__.

Available languages
===================

If on :file:`translate.novius-os.org` home page, your language is not listed under :guilabel:`Languages`, just `contact us <http://www.novius-os.org/en/more-info/contacts.html>`__. We'll add it for you.

Translation files
=================

Once your language is available on :file:`translate.novius-os.org`, click it. Then click the version of Novius OS you want to translate. If you don't know which one to choose, `ask us <http://www.novius-os.org/en/more-info/contacts.html>`__, we'll tell you.

You now see a list of directories. The directories starting with :file:`noviusos_` are applications. :file:`framework` contains the string from the core.

To start translating, click the :guilabel:`xx words need attention` next to a directory. Please follow these priorities:
* Top priority, the core: :file:`framework`.
* Then the native applications: Webpages (:file:`noviusos_pages`), Media Centre (:file:`noviusos_media`), Users (:file:`noviusos_user`) and Applications manager (:file:`noviusos_appmanager`).
* And finally the non-native applications.

Suggesting and submitting translations
======================================

Everybody can suggest translations. A suggestion will be reviewed by approved translators before being submitted. Only submitted translations are applied to Novius OS. Unreviewed or rejected suggestions stay in Pootle.

.. note::

    You don't even need to create an account to suggest translations. Nevertheless creating an account only takes you a minute and allows you to select your languages and avoid the CAPTCHA protection.
