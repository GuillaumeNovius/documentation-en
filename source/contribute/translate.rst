We take copywriting and translation very seriously. We have therefore established guidelines common to all applications and languages in order to provide every Novius OS user with consistent and enjoyable copy.

* Charte rédactionnelle (Français)

The copy style guide is to be read by every translator. If it's not available in your language then it is the first document to translate.
